\chapter{PDT Items}
\label{appendix:PDT_items}
The 30 picture description task (PDT) items discussed throughout Chapter~\ref{chap:data} are shown in this section. Each is displayed with its \textit{targeted} prompt. For all items, the \textit{untargeted} prompt is ``What is happening?'' Each item is marked as \textit{In}, \textit{Tr}, or \textit{Di} to denote it as either \textit{intransitive}, \textit{transitive}, or \textit{ditransitive}.

\chapter{Annotation Guide}
\label{appendix:annotation_guide}
The following pages consist of the annotation guide discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:annotation}. This guide was produced through an iterative process of annotation and discussion between the researchers, annotators and outside linguists. Minor typographical and stylistic errors have been corrected and some material has been reordered in this version (1.1) since it was applied to the SAILS Corpus, but the content of the guidelines here is effectively unchanged. The uncorrected version (1.0) as used for the annotation task is available for download with the SAILS Corpus.\footnote{https://github.com/sailscorpus/sails}
