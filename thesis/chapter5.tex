Describe process:

dependency parsing gigacorpus to ldh, xdh, xdx formats;

(gigacorpus info -- did I use full corpus or sample? check)

same for PDT responses;

dependency-based tf-idf for responses vs. gigacorpus;

get sorted superset of XGS \& response terms and their tf-idf scores;

get cosine of these vectors (``TC'' for tf-idf cosine; discuss how this compares to recent encoder based approaches (BERT), as this essentially is a primitive, more transparent encoder);

rank responses by TC;

get spearman of XGS \& TC based ranking vs ranking via the weighted feature annotations.
