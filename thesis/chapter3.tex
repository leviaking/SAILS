\section{Picture Description Task}
\label{sec:pdt}

%\subsection{PDT Stimuli}

The PDT is built around 30 images. Each image is a simple, cartoon-like vector graphic. These images were either purchased online or found in publicly available graphics libraries. In order to constrain response contents to the main action of each image, the images were modified to remove any non-essential detail or background. Vector graphics are ideal for this use, because they tend to have an illustrational style with very little detail, as compared to photographs or drawings. Moreover, most consist of layers of graphic objects, and these objects can be easily moved, resized, deleted, combined or otherwise modified to compose the desired stimulus. Example images are presented in Table~\ref{tab:example-pdt-items} and the full set is contained in Appendix XYZ \lk{XYZ=?}. To factor out the influence of previous linguistic context, images are intentionally devoid of any text or symbols. The only exceptions to this are two images with music notes, one with a legible analog clock, one with numerals in an arithmetic problem, and one with a question mark.

Each image was chosen for its depiction of an ongoing or imminent action, performed by a person or an animal. The images are divided evenly into actions that are canonically intransitive, transitive and ditransitive in English.

Each PDT image is used in two different contexts: \textbf{targeted} and \textbf{untargeted}. An \textbf{item} consists of an image and a prompt question. For \textbf{targeted} items, questions take the form of \textit{What is $<$subject$>$ doing?}, with the subject provided (e.g., \textit{the boy}, \textit{the bird}). For all \textbf{untargeted} items, the question is \textit{What is happening?} Thus, there are a total of 60 different items used in this study. Collecting these targeted and untargeted responses allows for the examination of response variation with and without a subject constraint. This could help inform approaches to task design and automatic content assessment \citep{foster2009native, cho2013investigating}. 

Multiple versions of the PDT were necessary to collect roughly equal numbers of targeted and untargeted \textbf{responses} for each image. These versions vary in which images are presented as targeted items and which images are presented as untargeted items. Additionally, NSs were asked to provide two non-identical responses to each item, but NNSs were asked to provide only one response per item, so different PDT versions were used for these groups. The PDTs were hosted online via Survey Monkey, and all participants submitted their responses through this platform. Survey Monkey restricts the number of questions included in surveys used for purchasing crowdsourced responses, so the PDTs were split accordingly for this group.

In each (full-length) PDT, targeted items are presented in the first half, and untargeted items are presented in the second half. This targeted-untargeted ordering is intended to avoid the possibility that in an untargeted-targeted task, respondents might notice that the question for each untargeted item is always the same in the first half and finish the task hastily without noticing that later targeted items specify the subject. Each half is introduced with instructions, including an example item with sample responses. The instructions ask participants to focus on the main event depicted in the image and for each response to be one complete sentence. The PDT was presented as an online survey, and all participants typed their responses. Participants were instructed not to use any reference materials, but browser-based spell checking was not disabled, and participants are assumed to have used it as necessary.

A complete paper-based version of the PDT is included in Appendix XYZ \lk{XYZ=?} and the full set of PDT versions is available for download with the SAILS Corpus.\footnote{https://github.com/sailscorpus/sails} The main task instructions are presented in (\ref{exe:pdt-instructions-a}). Additional instructions provided to NSs are presented in (\ref{exe:pdt-instructions-b}).

\begin{exe}
  \ex\label{exe:pdt-instructions-a}In this task, you will view a set of images. For each image, please write \textbf{one sentence} to answer the question provided with the image. It is important to write a \textbf{complete sentence}, not a word or phrase.
\end{exe}

\begin{exe}
  \ex\label{exe:pdt-instructions-b}Then, you will be asked to write a second, \textit{different} answer, which is also a complete sentence. This might involve rewording or reorganizing your first sentence. It does not need to be \textit{completely} different; some words may be the same. If you cannot think of another way to answer the question, you may leave the second answer space empty, but any second responses you provide will be greatly appreciated.
\end{exe}

%\subsection{Data Collection}
\section{Participants}
\label{sec:participants}

This study involved a total of 499 PDT participants. Of these, 141 were NNSs, recruited from intermediate and advanced writing courses for English as a Second Language students attending Indiana University. These participants performed the task in a computer lab with the researchers present. They were native speakers of Mandarin Chinese (125), Korean (4), Burmese (3), Hindi (2), and one native speaker each of Arabic, Indonesian Bahasa, German, Gujarati, Spanish, Thai and Vietnamese. Because nearly 90\% of these recruits were native speakers of Chinese, care should be taken when drawing conclusions from the corpus; patterns observed among the NNSs here might not apply broadly to all NNSs. 

Of the 358 NS participants, 29 were personally known and recruited by the researcher. Throughout this work, these participants will be referred to as the \textbf{Familiar Native Speakers (FNSs)}. Responses from the remaining 329 NSs were purchased via Survey Monkey, an online survey platform. These participants will be referred to as the \textbf{Crowdsourced Native Speakers (CNSs)} where participants earn credits they can redeem for gift cards and prizes. Due to length restrictions for purchased surveys, these NSs each completed only half of the task, so their data is equivalent to that of 164.5 full participants.

All participants completed a background questionnaire at the beginning of the PDT. This included questions about first and second languages, gender, age, national origin, amount of English language instruction and length of residency in English-speaking locations. This questionnaire is included as part of the PDT in Appendix XYX, and the background information provided by participants is included in the SAILS Corpus files. \lk{XYZ}

In previous similar work \citep{king:dickinson:13},
%\citep{king:dickinson:13,king:dickinson:16},
NSs were found to produce less variation than NNSs. Many NSs provided identical responses or responses that hew very closely to the most canonical way of expressing the main action. A major motivation for collecting the current corpus was the notion of assessing NNS response content by comparing it against the NS responses. For this reason, NSs were asked to provide two non-identical responses, in the hopes that this would result in a wide range of examples of native-like responses for the NNS responses to be compared against.

\section{Responses}
\label{sec:responses}

A total of 13,533 responses were collected. The response counts for each participant group are presented in Table~\ref{tab:response-counts}. The overwhelming majority of responses appear to be given in good faith, but a small number of responses (primarily from the CNS group) are problematic in this regard. These may contain gibberish or obscenities or are otherwise inappropriate for the task. Such responses would also be expected in an ICALL environment, so they were not removed from the corpus. Instead, these responses were simply annotated like all others (see Chapter~\ref{chapter:annotation}). Indeed, automatically assigning low scores to inappropriate responses is a central challenge and goal in this project (see Chapter XYZ)\lk{XYZ}.

\begin{table}[htb!]

\end{center}
\end{table}

To examine the degree of variation among the NSs and NNSs  in the current study, type-to-token ratios (TTR) were calculated on the response level for the entire set of items, shown in Table~\ref{tab:ttr}. For this calculation, final punctuation was ignored, and all responses were converted to lowercase. To illustrate, the three response \textit{tokens} in (\ref{exe:ttr-1}), (\ref{exe:ttr-2}) and (\ref{exe:ttr-3}) would constitute a single response \textit{type}.

\begin{exe}[h!]
  \ex\label{exe:ttr-1}The woman is holding a dog
\end{exe}
\begin{exe}[h!]
  \ex\label{exe:ttr-2}the woman is holding a dog!
\end{exe}
\begin{exe}[h!]
  \ex\label{exe:ttr-3}The Woman is holding a Dog.
\end{exe}

For each data point in Table~\ref{tab:ttr}, the corpus contains 10 items, for each of which there are roughly 150 NS responses and 70 NNS responses. To control for this imbalance and its effect on the likelihood of seeing new responses, the TTR was calculated for each item based on a random sample of 50 responses.  This was repeated 10 times and then averaged to produce a final TTR each item. Then, these were grouped as intransitives, transitives and ditransitives, and the TTR was calculated as the average for each group. The ratios show the direct relationship between the complexity of the event portrayed (represented here as intransitive, transitive and ditransitive) and the degree of variation elicited. In all cases, TTR increases with this complexity.
%Interestingly, this trend seems more pronounced in the NNS responses; in the targeted NNS responses, the TTRs for intransitive and ditransitive items are 0.381 and 0.817, respectively, compared to 0.628 and 0.835 for NS responses. \textbf{*Might this be explained by the inclusion of NNS 2nd responses? Let's investigate*}\lk{1st vs 2nd?} 
The ratios also show that in all cases, as expected, variation is greater for untargeted items than it is for targeted items. In other words, asking about a particular subject in the prompt question does constrain the variety of responses.

\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l||l|l||l|l|}
\hline
 & \multicolumn{2}{|c||}{Targeted} & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Untargeted} \\
\hline
 Set & NS & NNS & NS & NNS \\
\hline
\hline
Intrans & 0.628 & 0.381 & 0.782 & 0.492 \\
\hline
Trans & 0.752 & 0.655 & 0.859 & 0.779 \\ %%LK: Yes, 0.949 is correct in both cases here
\hline
Ditrans & 0.835 & 0.817 & 0.942 & 0.936 \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tab:ttr} NS and NNS type-to-token ratios (TTR) for complete responses (not words), for the full corpus.}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Additionally, from Table~\ref{tab:ttr} we can see that the NS set contains a greater degree of response variation than does the NNS set. Note that the TTRs here are calculated on \textit{all} responses, and the NS participants each provided two responses per item, whereas the NNS participants were only asked to provide one response per item. This suggests that asking for two responses is an effective way of collecting a broader range of NS responses. This variability can be more closely examined in Table~\ref{tab:ttr1v2}, which presents separate TTRs for all NS participants' first responses and second responses. Among first responses, variability increases along with item complexity. The pattern holds for targeted second responses, although it is not as pronounced. For untargeted second responses, this monotonic increase in variability is not present, but all three TTRs vary by less than three percent, suggesting that a ceiling effect may be at work.

\begin{table}[hb!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l||l|l||l|l|}
\hline
 & \multicolumn{2}{|c||}{Targeted} & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Untargeted} \\
\hline

\hline
\hline
Intrans & 0.343 & 0.819 & 0.549 & 0.939 \\
\hline
Trans & 0.509 & 0.895 & 0.682 & 0.926 \\ %%LK: Yes, 0.949 is correct in both cases here
\hline
Ditrans & 0.641 & 0.948 & 0.864 & 0.955  \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tab:ttr1v2} TTRs for complete responses, separated by first responses (R1) and second responses (R2). The ratios here are calculated from all NS responses; NNS responses are not included.}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Finally, for ease of comparison, Table~\ref{tab:ttr1v1} presents the (NS only) first response TTRs from Table~\ref{tab:ttr1v2} alongside the NNS first (and only) response TTRs from Table~\ref{tab:ttr}. These comparisons should be made with caution, however, as one cannot account for the possibility of task effects arising from the different instructions given to NS and NNS participants. In other words, it is possible that the anticipation of providing a second response influences a NS participant's choice of first response, and any such effect would be absent for NNS participants. A future study in which NSs are asked to provide only one response per item could be useful in examining the possibility of such a task effect. As it stands, the table suggests that NNSs generally do exhibit greater response variability than NSs; the only exception to this trend appears among the intransitive untargeted items. This trend is in keeping with the observations from previous work \citep{king:dickinson:13}, which found that NSs tend toward canonical forms, while NNSs use whatever language may be available to them, resulting in greater variation. As described above, this was the motivation for asking NSs for two responses.
