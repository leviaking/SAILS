\chapter{Related Work}

In this section, I want to discuss related work, including work that involves learner corpora (collecting, annotating for special purposes, etc.).

I also want to discuss work that involves automatically evaluating learner responses to tasks, particularly tasks involving a visual reference.

\section{My previous work}
Here I will discuss the work I have previously done in this area, including the papers given in the subsections below.

\subsection{2013}
\cite{king:dickinson:13}

\subsection{2014}
\citet{king:dickinson:14}

\subsection{2016}
\citep{king:dickinson:16}

\subsubsection{Bag-of-dependencies}
Here we could discuss the switch to a bag-of-dependencies approach, the use of tf-idf and the use of vector cosine distance for ranking responses.

\subsubsection{Clustering}
Here we could briefly mention the clustering experiments we did in the 2016 paper. But really, I'd rather not, because I don't intend to repeat them in the dissertation.

\subsection{2018}
\cite{king:dickinson:18}


\section{Other related work}
