    abstract = "{The basic assumption of quantitative authorship attribution is that the author of a text can be selected from a set of possible authors by comparing the values of textual measurements in that text to their corresponding values in each possible author's writing sample. Over the past three centuries, many types of textual measurements have been proposed, but never before have the majority of these measurements been tested on the same dataset. A large-scale comparison of textual measurements is crucial if current techniques are to be used effectively and if new and more powerful techniques are to be developed. This article presents the results of a comparison of thirty-nine different types of textual measurements commonly used in attribution studies, in order to determine which are the best indicators of authorship. Based on the results of these tests, a more accurate approach to quantitative authorship attribution is proposed, which involves the analysis of many different textual measurements.}",

Using these ideas together, the resulting tagger gives a 97.24\% accuracy on the Penn Treebank WSJ, an error reduction of 4.4\% on the best previous single automatically learned tagging result. },

We investigate limitations associated with previous methods, and propose a novel approach based on dynamic conditional random fields. Different from previous work, our proposed approach is designed to jointly perform both sentence boundary and sentence type prediction, and punctuation prediction on speech utterances. We performed evaluations on a transcribed conversational speech domain consisting of both English and Chinese texts. Empirical results show that our method outperforms an approach based on linear-chain conditional random fields and other previous approaches.}},

@article{duchier:etal:2009,
	Abstract = {Although the observation of grammaticality judgements is well acknowledged, their formal representation faces problems of different kinds: linguistic, psycholinguistic, logical, computational. In this paper we focus on addressing some of the logical and computational aspects, relegating the linguistic and psycholinguistic ones in the parameter space. We introduce a model-theoretic interpretation of Property Grammars, which lets us formulate numerical accounts of grammaticality judgements. Such a representation allows for both clear-cut binary judgements, and graded judgements. We discriminate between problems of Intersective Gradience (i.e., concerned with choosing the syntactic category of a model among a set of candidates) and problems of Subsective Gradience (i.e., concerned with estimating the degree of grammatical acceptability of a model). Intersective Gradience is addressed as an optimisation problem, while Subsective Gradience is addressed as an approximation problem.},
