%\section{Leftovers}
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item{We've been using the triple-based error annotation from our semantic triples experiments, but that was mostly a matter of convenience. What kind of annotation do we really want now? \textbf{What annotation is essential for us to be able to evaluate our system?}}
%\item{Data collection will be one of the first tasks we encounter. Should we (can we) stick with single (non-sequential) PDT items for simplicity's sake? If we use sequential PDTs, we'll need to think about anaphora resolution and maybe NER, etc.}
%\item{How much data will we need? (How many items? How many NNS participants? How many NS participants (and how many responses per item from each NS)? Should we hold out some data for testing?}
%\item{At some point in this process, we should publish our data sets (including the old one). Where should we fit this in the timeline, and how can we ensure that we submit to the IRB and collect our data in such a way to minimize the complications of publishing the data? (Mostly a ``note to self''...)}
%\item{I really like the feedback idea: Present the user with the most similar response in the gold standard and give some minimal information about how this GS sentence relates to the rest of the GS. I think it's a clever use of what we will have at hand (``good'' responses from the GS). I also think it \textit{seems} useful, but I'd like to see if I can find a solid SLA justification for it. From a practical consideration, I think it should be relatively simple to implement. I also think it fits fairly well with our intention to keep this project somewhat modular; it might not be the ideal form of feedback, but I think it seems like a nice ``stopping point'' for us on that front, and it would be a nice starting point for anyone wanting to expand our system to include more thorough feedback. How exactly will we determine which GS sentence is most similar to the NNS sentence? What kind of information about the sentence and the GS will we provide, and how will we derive that information?}
%\item{There are ideas that have come up repeatedly that I have not explicitly added to the timeline, namely semantic role labeling and WordNet. What can we say about these things now? Beyond simply allotting extra time for the experiments, do we have thoughts on how and where to incorporate these ideas?}
%\item{MD: How are PDTs used in second language assessment? Is a GS used? Or are all responses hand graded? (Check Chodorow, etc.)}
%\item{What does SLA literature have to say about ``nativeness''? Who works on this? What can we find?}
%\item{MD: Start forming PDT stuff; wrap up clustering, write up clustering -- keep in mind data is limited (mostly only transitives), so we don't know how well it would generalize; start lit review.}
%\item{MD: possible question: how lightweight can it be / does it need to be?}

%Start putting together BEA paper based on the work from this semester (clustering, etc.). Identify any gaps in what we need. (BEA deadline early March).

%%from 1/13 meeting:
%%research questions for proposal
%%writing diss intro and/or BEA paper
%%recover the BEA paper status (what remains to be done, etc.)
%%new data collection materials; what kind of things do we want? what are the criteria for new materials?

%% Next meeting, Tuesday, 2/2, 11am.

%%%motivation, looking toward BEA: various sentence types, there's more than yes or no to the quality of a response. Our scoring (vs. strict matching) also lends itself better to interesting feedback.
%%% We know the GS will be limited; we want to optimize it, but still, we need a more robust way of judging (SCORING) responses.

%%%BEA paper, prospectus.


%%%Remove lots of "we" language; can use "I", but try to avoid.
