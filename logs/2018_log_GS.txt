The GS files are fully parsed; see /Users/leviking/Documents/dissertation/SAILS/gold_standards/finalcsvs

Now I must begin the scoring process. I need to do leave one out testing on each of the gold standards.

Currently working on the files OLDprep_conll_for_tfidf.sh and OLDprep_conll_for_tfidf.py; I will rename these without the "OLD" when they are fully updated.
DONE.

Today I'm starting work on the leave-one-out (LOO) GS experiments. I need to drag out the tf-idf scripts from last time and prepare them for LOO.

Oh, this time, I'm only going to use the tf-idf cosine ("TC") approach; this was the clear winner in the pilot study. See the table pasted below. So it'll be TC and the Brown Corpus for sure, and I think I should look at xdh, ldh, and probably xdx.
For the term (depstring) forms,
Approach	form		Ref Corpus		
0.51577 TC xdh 0.51810 Brown 0.51534
0.50780 FC ldh 0.51677 WSJ 0.50798
0.50755 TA lxh 0.51350
0.49464 FA xdx 0.49901
			ldx 0.49352

I need these scripts: lk_tfidf.sh, lk_tfidf.py
These have been copied to the scripts folder as "OLDlk_tfidf*"; I'll remove the "OLD" when they are completed.
I'm not quite ready to implement LOO. These scripts simply compare dependencies in the test file with dependencies in the reference corpus and record the resulting tf-idf score for each term. I need to modify them to work on the csv files that now contain all the depstrings.

I've almost finished OLDlk_tfidf.py. It's basically working, but I need to uncomment the remaining deptypes in a couple of places in the main program; relatedly, I need to fix it so that I'm not working with empty lists after I run through the first deptype (I think this has something to do with the csvreader and/or the way the loop is managed).
