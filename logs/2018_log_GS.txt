The GS files are fully parsed; see /Users/leviking/Documents/dissertation/SAILS/gold_standards/finalcsvs

Now I must begin the scoring process. I need to do leave one out testing on each of the gold standards.

Currently working on the files OLDprep_conll_for_tfidf.sh and OLDprep_conll_for_tfidf.py; I will rename these without the "OLD" when they are fully updated.
DONE.
