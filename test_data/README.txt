pool/
Contains one file per item; each file contains all NNS responses for that item.
Each response is already parsed/lemmatized and formatted as LDH, XDH, XDX (labeled dependencies, unlabeled deps, and words); each file contains either exactly 70 or exactly 71 responses.

N70/
Contains one file per item; these are just resampled from the files in pool/ to get a consistent number of test responses for each test item (70 per item)
