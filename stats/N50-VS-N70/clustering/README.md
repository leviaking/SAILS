all_spearman_N70-clustering_vectors.csv is simply a modified version of all_spearman_N70.csv, where I've manually reorganized the scores into the vectors I need to cluster items according to the performance of different parameter settings. The clustering files here are generated by SAILS/scripts/clustering_items.py

The naming convention for these cluster files is a work in progress -- if I come up with a less confusing pattern I'll implement it and rename these. Every cluster file has a corresponding csv file that contains the dataframe used to generate the cluster drawing. This should help clarify how the cluster was drawn. Note that the "ranked_model" files are based on the ranking of each of the 12 models' performance on a given item, so the rank can range from 1-12. (I.e., the models are ranked, not the items; hence rankings are from 1-12 (models), not 1-30 (items)).
