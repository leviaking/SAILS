This version of the corpus retains the original formatting (i.e., the columns), but has been updated so that all files are based on an identical template. All files contain an identical number of rows, sorted in the same order (by RespondentID), where the demographic columns are identical from one file to the next. The files only differ in the response and annotation columns.

I will modify future versions:
I will change the long RespondentID; we have 498 respondents so we can assign IDs from 001-498.
